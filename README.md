# Laravel Learning Project

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a learning project where we're exploring multiple Laravel concepts in a single application. The codebase includes various experiments, practice exercises, and learning iterations, so the structure may not follow production best practices.

## About

This repository contains our Web Development course project where we're learning Laravel from scratch. We're practicing different concepts like MVC architecture, routing, middleware, authentication, and more - all within the same Laravel application.

## What We're Learning

-   MVC Architecture
-   Routing and Controllers
-   Blade Templating
-   Eloquent ORM
-   Middleware
-   Authentication

## Project Structure

Since this is a learning project, you'll find:

-   Multiple experimental features
-   Practice code and exercises
-   Work-in-progress implementations
-   Comments and notes throughout

We're prioritizing learning and experimentation over clean architecture!
